It provides an overview of the purpose of shiny, a brief description of the main components of a shiny app and an introduction to reactive programming. All these ideas are studied in more detail in the later chapters (hence, why we’ve skipped it). There are some notes on setting up R/RStudio for developing shiny apps, on the packages that should be installed, and some pointers about deploying shiny apps. When shiny-apps are developed as part of the book-club, we will typically deploy them to the R4DS shinyapps.io account. shinyapps.io has a lot of detail on releasing shiny-apps to the world. If you have any questions / problems setting up shiny for local use, or with deployment of a shiny app to shinyapps.io, feel free to ask in either the “book_club-mastering_shiny” or the “help-4-shiny” channel on the R4DS slack.

Create a reactive expression by wrapping a block of code in reactive({...}) and assigning it to a variable.

Imperative code is assertive; vs declarative code is passive-aggressive “Make me a sandwich” vs “Ensure there is a sandwich in the refrigerator whenever I look inside of it” In essesnce, you describe your overall goals, and the software figures out how to achieve them without further intervention. 3.2.2 Laziness It allows apps to be extremely lazy. A Shiny app will only ever do the minimal amount of work needed to update the output controls that you can currently see. CAUTION: If you’re working on a Shiny app and you just can’t figure out why your code never gets run, double check that your UI and server functions are using the same identifiers. 3.2.3 The reactive graph understanding order of execution code is only run when needed reactive graph - describes how inputs and outputs are connected - describe this relationship (output has a reactive dependency on input) mermaid(&quot; graph LR A[name] --- B&gt;greeting] &quot;) reactive graph is a powerful tool for understanding how your app works. - Make by hand - Use DiagrammeR pkg to make it manually yourself - Use reactlog pkg to do it automatically (more in later chapters) "],["reactive-expressions-1.html", "3.3 Reactive expressions", " 3.3 Reactive expressions What - A tool that reduces duplication in your reactive code by introducing additional nodes into the reactive graph How - using reactive() # Just for example server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { string &lt;- reactive(paste0(&quot;Hello &quot;, input$name, &quot;!&quot;)) output$greeting &lt;- renderText(string()) } In other words , makes app cleaner &amp; more efficient (by removing redundant codes &amp; recomputation).
