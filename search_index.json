It provides an overview of the purpose of shiny, a brief description of the main components of a shiny app and an introduction to reactive programming. All these ideas are studied in more detail in the later chapters (hence, why we’ve skipped it). There are some notes on setting up R/RStudio for developing shiny apps, on the packages that should be installed, and some pointers about deploying shiny apps. When shiny-apps are developed as part of the book-club, we will typically deploy them to the R4DS shinyapps.io account. shinyapps.io has a lot of detail on releasing shiny-apps to the world. If you have any questions / problems setting up shiny for local use, or with deployment of a shiny app to shinyapps.io, feel free to ask in either the “book_club-mastering_shiny” or the “help-4-shiny” channel on the R4DS slack.

Create a reactive expression by wrapping a block of code in reactive({...}) and assigning it to a variable.

Imperative code is assertive; vs declarative code is passive-aggressive “Make me a sandwich” vs “Ensure there is a sandwich in the refrigerator whenever I look inside of it” In essesnce, you describe your overall goals, and the software figures out how to achieve them without further intervention. 3.2.2 Laziness It allows apps to be extremely lazy. A Shiny app will only ever do the minimal amount of work needed to update the output controls that you can currently see. CAUTION: If you’re working on a Shiny app and you just can’t figure out why your code never gets run, double check that your UI and server functions are using the same identifiers. 3.2.3 The reactive graph understanding order of execution code is only run when needed reactive graph - describes how inputs and outputs are connected - describe this relationship (output has a reactive dependency on input) mermaid(&quot; graph LR A[name] --- B&gt;greeting] &quot;) reactive graph is a powerful tool for understanding how your app works. - Make by hand - Use DiagrammeR pkg to make it manually yourself - Use reactlog pkg to do it automatically (more in later chapters) "],["reactive-expressions-1.html", "3.3 Reactive expressions", " 3.3 Reactive expressions What - A tool that reduces duplication in your reactive code by introducing additional nodes into the reactive graph How - using reactive() # Just for example server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { string &lt;- reactive(paste0(&quot;Hello &quot;, input$name, &quot;!&quot;)) output$greeting &lt;- renderText(string()) } In other words , makes app cleaner &amp; more efficient (by removing redundant codes &amp; recomputation).

Allows you to reduce the time between making a change and seeing the outcome The faster you can iterate, the faster you can experiment, and the faster you can become a better Shiny developer. Two main workflows to optimise here: creating apps (for first time), making changes and experimenting with the results faster (speeding up the iterative cycle). 5.3.1 Creating apps Type shinyapp in app.R and you will see prompt to insert snippet(Shift + Tab) If you are using RStudio, you can create Shiny Web Application project easily 5.3.2 Seeing your changes faster Avoid clicking “Run App” button Use keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter Turn auto reload on and run the app in the background as described here. gives faster workflow: write some code, Cmd/Ctrl + S to save the file and experiment interactively. disadvantage: harder to debug because the app is running in a separate process. 5.3.3 Controlling the view Run in Viewer Pane: opens the app in the viewer pane . for smaller apps Run External: opens the app in your usual web browser. useful for larger apps "],["debugging.html", "5.4 Debugging", " 5.4 Debugging something will go wrong definitely. it takes years of experience to write code that works the first time (So, we need a robust workflow for identifying and fixing mistakes) Specific focus to three debugging challenges to Shiny apps 5.4.1 Three dubugging Challenges(What goes wrong) You get an unexpected error (easiest case). Solution : You will get a traceback which allows you to figure out exactly where the error occurred The interactive debugger is a powerful assistant for this process. You don’t get any errors, Solution: use the interactive debugger, along with your investigative skills to track down the root cause. All the values are correct, but they’re not updated when you expect Most challenging problem because it’s unique to Shiny, so you can’t take advantage of your existing R debugging skills. 5.4.2 How to fix errors (using tracebacks) In R, every error is accompanied by a traceback, or call stack, which literally traces back through the sequence of calls that lead to the error The functions are printed in reverse order The traceback tool pinpoints the location of an error. Example of reading traceback f &lt;- function(x) g(x) g &lt;- function(x) h(x) h &lt;- function(x) 2 * 2 f(3) ## [1] 4 f &lt;- function(x) g(x) g &lt;- function(x) h(x) h &lt;- function(x) x * 2 f(&quot;a&quot;) This will generate an error below f(&quot;a&quot;) #&gt; Error in x * 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator The traceback is shown below: Top of the stack point to an error traceback() #&gt; 3: h(x) #&gt; 2: g(x) #&gt; 1: f(&quot;a&quot;) Flipping the traceback shows the better sequence(the top of the stack poins to an error location) shows sequence of calls that lead to the error — f() called g() called h() (which errors) 1: f(&quot;a&quot;) 2: g(x) 3: h(x) 5.4.2 Tracebacks in Shiny You can’t use traceback() in Shiny because you can’t run code while an app is running. Shiny automatically print the traceback for you. library(shiny) f &lt;- function(x) g(x) g &lt;- function(x) h(x) h &lt;- function(x) x * 2 ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, 1:10), plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ n &lt;- f(input$n) plot(head(cars, n)) }, res = 96) } shinyApp(ui, server) We will see an error below Error in *: non-numeric argument to binary operator 169: g [app.R#4] 168: f [app.R#3] 167: renderPlot [app.R#13] 165: func 125: drawPlot 111: &lt;reactive:plotObj&gt; 95: drawReactive 82: renderFunc 81: output$plot 1: runApp We can also flip the error Error in *: non-numeric argument to binary operator 1: runApp 81: output$plot 82: renderFunc 95: drawReactive 111: &lt;reactive:plotObj&gt; 125: drawPlot 165: func 167: renderPlot [app.R#13] 168: f [app.R#3] 169: g [app.R#4] 5.4.3 Three part of Shiny error stack First: few calls start the app. Ignore anything before the first runApp(); this is just the setup code to get the app running. 1: runApp #Sometimes, you may see other things before runAPP ignore them #1: source #3: print.shiny.appobj #5: runApp Second: some internal Shiny code in charge of calling the reactive expression(output$plot is where the problem is) : 81: output$plot 82: renderFunc 95: drawReactive 111: &lt;reactive:plotObj&gt; 125: drawPlot 165: func Third: Code that you have written 167: renderPlot [app.R#13] 168: f [app.R#3] 169: g [app.R#4] 5.4.4 How to fix errors (using interactive debugger) You have identified the error using traceback and want to figure out what’s causing it, Use the interactive debugger to debugg your code Two ways to launch the debugger: Add a call to browser() in your source code if (input$value == &quot;a&quot;) { browser() } # Or maybe if (my_reactive() &lt; 0) { browser() } Add an RStudio breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line number "],["getting-help-using-reprex.html", "5.5 Getting help (using Reprex)", " 5.5 Getting help (using Reprex) If you cant debug the error, it is time to ask for help at Shiny Community by creating Reprex A reprex is just some R code that works when you copy and paste it into a R session on another computer Good reprex, makes it easy for others to help you debug your app Below is an example of Shiny reprex 5.5.1 How to make a reprex Create a single self-contained file that contains everything needed to run your code (e.g load all packages) Test it by restarting fresh R session and then running the code Potential problem is sharing your data Use buil-in datasets(mpg), create sample datasets and illustrate the problem, use subset of the data with dput() (mydata &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;))) ## x y ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 b ## 3 3 c ## 4 4 d ## 5 5 e dput(mydata) ## structure(list(x = 1:5, y = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;)), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, ## -5L)) Last resort is to provide complete app.R and the needed data files using Gihub or Zip files (if reading data from disk seems irreducible part of the problem) Make sure you use relative paths Format your code for to be easy read Use styler package if you adopt tidyverse style guide 5.5.2 Making a minimal reprex Trim out all the code that’s ok (make the life of a helper much easier) rather than forcing a potential helper to understand your entire app. This process often lead you to discover what the problem is, so you don’t have to wait for help from someone else! A good way to find error code is to remove sections of code from your application, piece by piece, until the problem goes away If removing a particular piece of code makes the problem stop, it’s likely that that code is related to the problem. 5.5.2.1 Example of Bad reprex all the needed packages are not loaded The code is not style, making it uneasy to help library(shiny) shinyApp( ui = fluidPage( uiOutput(&quot;interaction_slider&quot;), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;breaks&quot;) ), server = function(input, output, session) { df &lt;- data.frame (dateTime = c(&quot;2019-08-20 16:00:00&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:01&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:02&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:03&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:04&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:05&quot;), var1 = c(9, 8, 11, 14, 16, 1), var2 = c(3, 4, 15, 12, 11, 19), var3 = c(2, 11, 9, 7, 14, 1) ) timeSeries &lt;- as.xts(df[,2:4],order.by=strptime(df[,1], format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)) print (paste(min(time(timeSeries)),is.POSIXt(min(time(timeSeries))),sep=&#39; &#39;)) print (paste(max(time(timeSeries)),is.POSIXt(max(time(timeSeries))),sep=&#39; &#39;)) output$interaction_slider &lt;- renderUI({ sliderInput( &quot;slider&quot;, 5.5.2.2 Making the bad reprex better(minimal) loaded needd packages The code is style, making it easy to help library(xts) library(lubridate) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( uiOutput(&quot;interaction_slider&quot;), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;breaks&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { df &lt;- data.frame( dateTime = c( &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:00&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:01&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:02&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:03&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:04&quot;, &quot;2019-08-20 16:00:05&quot; ), var1 = c(9, 8, 11, 14, 16, 1), var2 = c(3, 4, 15, 12, 11, 19), var3 = c(2, 11, 9, 7, 14, 1) ) timeSeries &lt;- as.xts(df[, 2:4], order.by = strptime(df[, 1], format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;) ) print(paste(min(time(timeSeries)), is.POSIXt(min(time(timeSeries))), sep = &quot; &quot;)) print(paste(max(time(timeSeries)), is.POSIXt(max(time(timeSeries))), sep = &quot; &quot;)) output$interaction_slider &lt;- renderUI({ sliderInput( &quot;slider&quot;, &quot;Select Range:&quot;, min = min(time(timeSeries)), max = max(time(timeSeries)), value = c(min, max) ) }) brks &lt;- reactive({ req(input$slider) seq(input$slider[1], input$slider[2], length.out = 10) }) output$breaks &lt;- brks } shinyApp(ui, server) Remove part of the code that is independent with the error(e.g two lines starting with print(), timeSeres and df) new server calls reduced: datetime &lt;- Sys.time() + (86400 * 0:10) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$interaction_slider &lt;- renderUI({ sliderInput( &quot;slider&quot;, &quot;Select Range:&quot;, min = min(datetime), max = max(datetime), value = c(min, max) ) }) brks &lt;- reactive({ req(input$slider) seq(input$slider[1], input$slider[2], length.out = 10) }) output$breaks &lt;- brks } Next, the example uses a relatively sophisticated Shiny technique where the UI is generated in the server function. But the renderUI() doesn’t use any reactive inputs, so it should work the UI. this leads to new UI that generate the error: ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(&quot;slider&quot;, &quot;Select Range:&quot;, min = min(datetime), max = max(datetime), value = c(min, max) ), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;breaks&quot;) ) #&gt; Error: Type mismatch for `min`, `max`, and `value`. #&gt; i All values must have same type: either numeric, Date, or POSIXt. looking at each of the inputs we’re feeding to min, max, and value to see where the problem is: min(datetime) #&gt; [1] &quot;2021-03-15 23:20:03 UTC&quot; max(datetime) #&gt; [1] &quot;2021-03-25 23:20:03 UTC&quot; c(min, max) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; function (..., na.rm = FALSE) .Primitive(&quot;min&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; function (..., na.rm = FALSE) .Primitive(&quot;max&quot;) Now the problem is obvious: we haven’t assigned min and max variables ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(&quot;slider&quot;, &quot;Select Range:&quot;, min = min(datetime), max = max(datetime), value = range(datetime) ), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;breaks&quot;) ) "],["layout-themes-html.html", "Chapter 6 Layout, themes, HTML", " Chapter 6 Layout, themes, HTML library(bslib) library(htmltools) library(shiny) "],["disclaimer.html", "6.1 Disclaimer", " 6.1 Disclaimer “Mastering Shiny” is a moving target.

As we know the basic structure of a Shiny app is made of a UI (user interface) and a Server. The first example is the User Interface and Server basic structure for updating the app. ############################################ # ui &lt;- fluidPage( # [id]Input(), # actionButton() # ) ############################################# # server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { # observeEvent(input$... , { # update[id]Input(inputId = ... , ... = input$... ) # }) # ... # } 10.2.1 Update functions The Update function allows you to modify the control after it has been created with a series of [id]Input and update[id]Input, as shown below: # [id]Input() # textInput() # ui # update [....] Input() # updateTextInput() # server # numericInput() # update [....] Input() # updateNumericInput() #------------------------------------- # selectInput() # update [....] Input() # updateSelectInput() # sliderInput() # update [....] Input() # updateSliderInput() Hierarchical, Freezing and Circular references Other considerations need to be done when requesting the app to update following an interactive input request made by the user. For example, the selection of natural hierarchy in the data is one of them, and it is important to create a user interface that allows updating the input maintaining stability while dynamically generating changes across multiple categories. Further considerations involve establishing priorities with the application of key features such as freezing Reactive Inputs, a provided feature to freeze part of the inputs when expected a series of changes and so for establishing priorities and visually summarize data correctly. # [id]Input() # tableOutput() # observeEvent() # update[id]Input() The function update[id]Input() only affects all outputs and observers that have run, for this reason, the freezing function would let you hierarchically updating all your inputs before displaying it. # [id]Input() # [some]Output() # observeEvent() # freezeReactiveValue() “freezing” the input # update[id]Input() The last consideration for this section is to circularity as seen in many apps, it is created when requested for making simultaneous changes recursively. In other words, it is seen in apps when updating the input, automatically another input is created in the function of the first one. Under this condition, the cycle can create an recursive loop on the current value of the input bringing it to run again and again in circularity. How the “Action button” reset the input A simple example of the use of this command is the Reset button. It is one of the clearest examples of what is meant with making dynamic changes. When the user interactively intervenes on the app making a choice, then the “reset” button makes it easy to reset the parameters back to their initial value. # [id]Input() # actionButton() # observeEvent() # update[id]Input() # [id]Input() # actionButton() # observeEvent() # updateActionButton() A simple use of the reset input button is shown in this example: Spring temperature generally varies on average between 19 and 25 C° degrees, let’s set an average value of 21 C° as reset point. ui &lt;- fluidPage( sliderInput(&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;Spring temperature&quot;, 21, min = 19, max = 25), actionButton(&quot;reset&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { observeEvent(input$reset,{ updateSliderInput(inputId = &quot;temperature&quot;, value = 21) }) } "],["dynamic-visibility.html", "10.3 Dynamic visibility", " 10.3 Dynamic visibility To show and hide parts of the UI dynamically and interactively. The tabsetPanel() is the second function for this chapter and it involves the visibility of part of the app. This second function is made to let the user show and/or hide some of the tabs set in the main panel. It is a technique that allows managing the appearance of the app with selecting visibility of the tabs as shown in the Tabsets section of the Shiny.rstudio.com guide’s page of the website. To enhance your app with features and the most wanted themes and as an example on how to set the visibility of a tab in your app, you can follow the steps found here: Gallery As an example here is shown how to switch between panels hiding one panel and showing the other with different content. library(shiny) ################## switcher ############################## ui &lt;- fluidPage( sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( selectInput(&quot;controller&quot;, &quot;Show&quot;, choices = c(&quot;plot&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;)) ), mainPanel( tabsetPanel( id = &quot;switcher&quot;, type = &quot;hidden&quot;, tabPanelBody(&quot;plot&quot;, &quot;Plot&quot;), tabPanelBody(&quot;summary&quot;, &quot;Summary&quot;) ) ) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { observeEvent(input$controller, { updateTabsetPanel(inputId = &quot;switcher&quot;, selected = input$controller) }) } Finally, the technique of the Conditional UI allows you to simulate different parameters to be set in the app. The tabsetPanel() is updated with input requests as a separate section with different types of [id]Input() and then embedded inside a fuller UI. Example of a chunk of code to be integrated in the UI: parameter_tabs &lt;- tabsetPanel( tabPanel(&quot;normal&quot;, numericInput(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;mean&quot;, value = 1) ) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( numericInput(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;Number of samples&quot;, value = 100), parameter_tabs # where to set the chunk of code ), mainPanel( plotOutput(&quot;hist&quot;) ) ) ) There are other options to use to be able to switch among different pages, an example of this is creating a wizard and using the switch_page() function, this will be shown in Chapter 18 - Functions as said in the book.

This was one of the major drawbacks of employing Shiny apps. It is super inconvenient for you and your stakeholders to have to input the exact parameters in your application in order to produce the results you are trying to share. Now with bookmarking functionality, this problem is addressed. The rest of this chapter is going to illustrate concepts using the Shiny application proposed in Exercise #1, which displays the results of ambient::noise-simplex(). "],["modifying-app-to-be-bookmarkable.html", "11.2 Modifying app to be bookmarkable", " 11.2 Modifying app to be bookmarkable There are three main parts you must modify in a Shiny app in order for it to be bookmarkable: In the ui: make it a function In the ui: add the bookmarkButton() function In the shinyApp() call: include enableBookmarking = \"url\" ui &lt;- function(request) { fluidPage( sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( sliderInput(&quot;omega&quot;, &quot;omega&quot;, value = 1, min = -2, max = 2, step = 0.01), sliderInput(&quot;delta&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, value = 1, min = 0, max = 2, step = 0.01), sliderInput(&quot;damping&quot;, &quot;damping&quot;, value = 1, min = 0.9, max = 1, step = 0.001), numericInput(&quot;length&quot;, &quot;length&quot;, value = 100), bookmarkButton() ), mainPanel( plotOutput(&quot;fig&quot;) ) ) ) } shinyApp(ui, server, enableBookmarking = &quot;url&quot;) Making the ui a function Why? Because Shiny needs to be able to modify the input controls specified by the URL. Like arguments are passed within a normal R function as parameters to produce different outputs, the ui now needs to take in an argument (the URL) in order to return the app into a particular state. The URL holds information on the input parameters that needs to be changed, hence why the ui now needs to be a function. Adding the bookmarkButton() button to the app This function adds a button to the ui that captures the current values of all the input controls and generates a URL from it. More on this later. Adding enableBookmarking = \"url\" to the shinyApp() call This function ultimately puts the app together - the ui and the server. Adding this argument tells Shiny enable bookmarking and that the bookmark will be URL-encoded vs saved-on-server. More on this later "],["breaking-down-the-url.html", "11.3 Breaking down the URL", " 11.3 Breaking down the URL A default URL that is generated from within a Shiny app will look something like this: https://hadley.shinyapps.io/ms-bookmark-url/?_inputs_&amp;damping=0.966&amp;delta=1.25&amp;length=100&amp;omega=-0.54 OR http://127.0.0.1:4087/?_inputs_&amp;damping=0.997&amp;delta=1.37&amp;length=500&amp;omega=-0.9 But what do all these words and numbers mean? "],["updating-the-url.html", "11.4 Updating the URL", " 11.4 Updating the URL It is probably more convenient to have the URL just update itself whenever inputs change instead of having the user press button each time a state must be captured. This can be accomplished by wrapping information like input values and session information around an observer as such: observe({ reactiveValuesToList(input) session$doBookmark() }) The reactiveValuesToList(input) step does what you might expect as.list() to do in base R. It takes the reactive object, input and stores its values and dependencies in a list. The next step invokes the doBookmark() function from the session object. The session object is an environment that can be used to access information and functionality relating to the session. doBookmark() invokes the onBookmarked() callback function. FYI: a callback function is: a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed. 11.4.1 Storing a richer state URL bookmarking is simple and works everywhere you may want to deploy your Shiny app however, could become very long if you have a large number of inputs. If this is the case, it may be better to store your state on the server side. Shiny saves the state of your app in an .rds file on the server and generates a shorter and easier URL. To do this, you can simply change the enableBookmarking argument to be “server” instead of “url” shinyApp(ui, server, enableBookmarking = &quot;server&quot;) This generates URLs like this: http://127.0.0.1:4087/?_state_id_=0d645f1b28f05c97 The parameter in this instance is the state_id which corresponds to a directory in your working directory - shiny_bookmarks/0d645f1b28f05c97 ⚠️ Be sure to have a mechanism to routinely delete these directories. If your app requires bookmarking in a complex state and you do not delete these files, your app is going to take up more disk space and may start to lag. However, when you do delete these files, their corresponding URLs will also stop working. Just be sure to either send updated links to stakeholders or be mindful of the state of your app. "],["bookmarking-challenges.html", "11.5 Bookmarking Challenges", " 11.5 Bookmarking Challenges You must be extra cautious if your app relies on random number generation.

The questions we are going to answer in these notes of the Mastering Shiny book by Hadley Wickham are: What’s happening inside the app? How to escape the constraints of the reactive graph? General usage of the reactiveVal() and observe()/observeEvent() functions is on a small scale, the interaction in bigger pieces results more complicated. A second suggestion is to keep the chunk of code isolated from the rest of the app so that the smallest possible number of observers modify the reactive value. To recap: Reactive programming is used to specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all related outputs are automatically updated. The reactive graph describes how inputs and outputs are connected, it is a powerful tool for understanding how your app works, and it’s useful to sketch the dependencies in your graph.

In this first part we learn how to combine reactive values which are escaping the graph and to do this we need to: 1 - modify the value of a reactive value 2 - use reactiveVal() or reactiveValues() functions 3 - combine them with observe() and observeEvent() in the server In particular, we will see how invalidation caused by the user might not be captured by the reactivity graph, and for this reason, it is said to be escaping the graph. An example is a request of changing the input made by the user, such as when using the reset button (made with an actionbutton()), which is not evidenced in the reactivity graph. The figure below shows an app with an actionButton(), the input value of the app changes but the reactivity graph stays the same. The reactive graph does not capture the connection between the unnamed observer and the input. reactlog_enable() ui &lt;- fluidPage( textInput(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Your name here&quot;), actionButton(&quot;clr&quot;, &quot;Clear&quot;), textOutput(&quot;salutation&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { # reactive function hello &lt;- reactive(paste0(&quot;Hello &quot;, input$name)) output$salutation &lt;- renderText(hello()) # observer observeEvent(input$clr, { updateTextInput(session, &quot;name&quot;, value = &quot;&quot;) }) } # shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) To have an idea of what is happening inside the app we can sketch a graph of the connections with one of the {diagrammeR} functions for making flowcharts, such as the mermaid() function, so, we visually identify the connections related to the action of the reset button. Figure 15.2 Graph of the App Figure 15.2: Graph of the steps made by the app In this contest, the reactive graph represent a static connection that doesn’t show the recursivity of the reset.

The reactive graph can be activated with the following commands: # reactlog::reactlog_enable() # or # options(shiny.reactlog = TRUE) Then you can access to it by clicking [Ctrl+F3] in Windows or [cmd + F3] in Mac while the app is running. This feature lets you see the structure of the connections made by the app. To mind is the escaping the graphs status, generated by previous conditions, which the reactive graph doesn’t take into consideration. For this reason, the main suggestion is to keep the conditions not reckon by the reactive graph feature on a small scale and use dedicated functions such as isolate() in combination with the recursivity of the app. In addition, the DiagrammeR package can be of help for you to see the missing piece of a connection in the structure, with the re-building of the reactive graph manually. 15.5.1 Resources: Experimental packages designed to explore “higher order” reactivity: reactlog rxtools More readings: Reactivity-overview Reactive programming mermaid "],["best-practices-general-guidelines.html", "Chapter 16 (Best practices) General guidelines", " Chapter 16 (Best practices) General guidelines Big apps or big teams == New challenges Organisation Stability Maintainability "],["best-practices-section-of-the-book.html", "16.1 “Best practices” section of the book", " 16.1 “Best practices” section of the book Software engineering approach &amp; mindset (today’s chapter) Decomposition: into functions into modules Organisation into packages Stability Testing Security Performance "],["software-engineering.html", "16.2 Software engineering", " 16.2 Software engineering "],["code-organization.html", "16.3 Code organization", " 16.3 Code organization Empathy Code clarity Comments Function size Copy/Paste development Shiny: functions, modules "],["testing.html", "16.4 Testing", " 16.4 Testing What is a “test plan” Why does testing improve stability of an app Automation vs Manual Test types: Unit, Integration, Functional, Load ….

We need to search for alternative solutions to the impossibility of stopping an attacker from invading your app and its content. It is important not to underestimate combinations or substitutions of functions that would be preventable errors in chain creation. "],["the-security-within-your-app.html", "19.2 The security within your app", " 19.2 The security within your app Two main security actions: Shiny inputs use client-side validation such as data that is user-specific and need the user to authenticate before use Shiny server() code isolation; one user cannot see data from another user in a different session, the only exception is if caching is in use, more about this is specified in the last chapter of the book Data Sensitive data and passwords are the most targeted objectives of the attackers, for this reason is recommended to: do not store password in the source code of your app, but eventually, in a variable in the environment use a .yml file to store login credentials use .gitignore to include the appropriate files containing your authentication credentials Authentication and client-side validation There is more than one alternative to authenticate, first thing is that you need to add some kind of layer between the user interface and the Shiny server, i.e. a proxy Figure 19.1: proxy It will redirect the user to an authentication page, as in a login page, and once authenticated it will check whether the user is authorized, and then let them get access to the Shiny application. The following section lists five packages for configuration, authentication, and storage of login credentials. There are several options to choose from based on your need and design of the app. Packages: 1 - The first package suggested by the book is {config} package, it is used to manage environment specific configuration values. Figure 19.2: config package How to install config and all the other packages (substituting the package’s name where appropriate): install.packages(“config”) library(config) How to store the password in a file with config in practice ? The package makes easier to deploy content, and in this context is used to keep the credentials outside of the R script by saving them in the config.yml file while keeping it in the current working directory. YAML(tm) are type of files made for making easier international collaboration with a language which is both human readable and computationally powerful. An example of a .yml file is a config.yml file: default: uid: “my-name” pwd: “my-password” And to recall the information back from its directory: config &lt;- config::get(file = “conf/config.yml”) config\\(uid config\\)pwd 2 - Another interesting package, mentioned in the search-engine of “securing a Shiny app” is {auth0} package. Figure 19.3: auth0 package It is an identity provider, it offers a server where to store shiny apps as well as procedures for setting credentials at access. You need an account where to load your app and set up the credentials. _auth0.yml files can be created with the command use_auth0() which can be automatically positioned in the app.R directory and it is already filled with basic information: auth0::use_auth0() Here is the content of the _auth0.yml file: name: myApp remote_url: ’’ auth0_config: api_url: !expr paste0(‘https://’, Sys.getenv(‘AUTH0_USER’), ‘.auth0.com’) credentials: key: !expr Sys.getenv(“AUTH0_KEY”) secret: !expr Sys.getenv(“AUTH0_SECRET”) Then set up the keys using usethis::edit_r_environ(“project”) which adds a .Renviron file in your project directory for you to modify the content with AUTH0_USER = … AUTH0_KEY = … AUTH0_SECRET = … It adds a layer between Shiny and the user. And then you can retrieve the credentials using Sys.getenv() auth0::Sys.getenv(“AUTH0_USER”) This method is not exclusive of auth0package but is a recommended approach to use for storing Credentials inside Environment Variables even with other packages. 3 - A simple and secure authentication mechanism for single ‘Shiny’ applications is through {shinymanager} package. Figure 19.4: shinymanager package Here is a live demonstration of the potentiality of this package: Shiny-server shinyapps.io it follows with these authentication credentials: user: shiny / password: shiny user: shinymanager / password: shinymanager (Admin) In particular it provides a function to secure_app() in which to wrap the ui: Wrap your UI with secure_app ui &lt;- secure_app(ui, choose_language = TRUE) As well as in the server() with the following commands: secure_server() check_credentials() 4 - The {shinyauthr} package is very useful for providing key function to use. Figure 19.5: shinyauthr package These are the main functions which invisibly call JavaScript with the command shinyjs::useShinyjs() internally: loginUI() loginServer() logoutUI() logoutServer() It also provides a method for cookie-based automatic login, which means that the system can store the credentials for some time as established by the creator of the app. 5 - {sodium} package is software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more. Figure 19.6: sodium package Generally used in this contest to encrypt passwords with simple commands such as: user_name = “user_authr_1”, password = sodium::password_store(“pass_authr_1”) which releases the password in this format: password = &quot;pass_authr_1&quot; sodium::password_store(password) ## [1] &quot;$7$C6..../....A8yuttCmgAErb14SYqyFq/5vmM4VLNkNGF7Mu3758RD$6ZN2F6U3vKxF1CyuUcWH7zerir7ppCqdevoJrNppFW.&quot; hash &lt;- sodium::password_store(password) sodium::password_verify(hash, password) ## [1] TRUE Another suggestion by the book is to use: Figure 19.7: Kerberos Kerberos (/ˈkɜːrbərɒs/) is a computer-network authentication protocol developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and classified as “Auxiliary Military Equipment” by the authorites for its capacities of Data Encryption Standard (DES). The development of the product followed with version updates and the implementation by other institutions included the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and the Stanford University made the system available outside the US with some limitations. Kerberos is available with RStudio Pro Products. In general what happens in an app when setting up login credentials is described below. In the ui you can use these commands for wrapping your code and build a module, while in the server() you should mind not to storage any form of credentials, but as said, storage them in a separate file (.xlm , .yml , .rds, .Renviron, …). The server() should include the eventReactive() function to check whether the user’s login and password are valid credentials, raising a silent validation error. server&lt;- function(input,output,session){ eventReactive() } Examples: 1 - In this example is shown for simplicity an application of the {shinyauthr}: the credentials are located inside the server(), they should be in a config.yml file and then retrieved for use. You may find yourself being prompted with something like this: Figure 19.8: Credentials library(shiny) # dataframe that holds usernames, passwords and other user data user_base &lt;- dplyr::tibble( user = c(&quot;user1&quot;, &quot;user2&quot;), password = c(&quot;pass1&quot;, &quot;pass2&quot;), permissions = c(&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;), name = c(&quot;User One&quot;, &quot;User Two&quot;) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( # add logout button UI div(class = &quot;pull-right&quot;, # The HTML tag functions in Shiny, like div() and p() return objects that can be rendered as HTML shinyauthr::logoutUI( id = &quot;logout&quot;)), # add login panel UI function shinyauthr::loginUI( id = &quot;login&quot;), # setup table output to show user info after login tableOutput(&quot;user_table&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { # call login module supplying data frame, # user and password cols and reactive trigger credentials &lt;- shinyauthr::loginServer( id = &quot;login&quot;, data = user_base, user_col = user, pwd_col = password, log_out = reactive(logout_init()) ) # call the logout module with reactive trigger to hide/show logout_init &lt;- shinyauthr::logoutServer( id = &quot;logout&quot;, active = reactive(credentials()$user_auth) ) output$user_table &lt;- renderTable({ # use req to only render results when credentials()$user_auth is TRUE req(credentials()$user_auth) # only run after a successful login credentials()$info }) } #shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) When accessing an API or database in R, Shiny inputs use client-side validation and often requires to provide credentials such as a login name and password. 2 - Another example of Shiny inputs using client-side validation (input performed by JavaScript in the browser) where is possible for an attacker to send unexpected values is: secrets &lt;- list( a = &quot;my name&quot;, b = &quot;my birthday&quot;, c = &quot;my social security number&quot;, d = &quot;my credit card&quot; ) allowed &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, choices = allowed), textOutput(&quot;secret&quot;) ) An attacker can open up a JavaScript console in their browser and run Shiny.setInputValue(\"x\", \"c\") to see client data that are not allowed to see. To add a layer of security, in the server() is added the req() function, which ensure that values are available, and if any of the given values is not truthy, the operation is stopped by raising a “silent” exception. ?req() server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$secret &lt;- renderText({ req(input$x %in% allowed) # this function secrets[[input$x]] }) } # shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) Finally, in case you want to skip the authentication step when testing the app: Use testthat::skip() to automatically skip tests that require authentication.
